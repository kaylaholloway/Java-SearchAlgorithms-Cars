# Java-SearchAlgorithms-Cars

This project contains a CSV file which contains over 5,000 different makes and models of cars. 
Using two different implementations of search algorithms, a linear seach and a binary search algorithm. 
The user inputs the car make and model they are looking for and the program parses through the file letting the user know if we have that car in stock or not.
